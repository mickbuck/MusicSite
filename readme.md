This is the source code used for https://mymusic.mickbuck.gq, I use this to track my music purchases to help stop me buying the same album more than once.

Idea for GUI from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/build-a-grocery-store-web-app-using-php-with-mysql/
Idea for DB from https://github.com/jesimone57/sql_music_examples

PLEASE NOTE THIS IS VERY MUCH EARLY STAGE WIP.

This site runs off MySQL (MariaDB) and PHP. I personally run it on a Apache Server on Debian for the production version, and Apache on FreeBSD my test area.

There are a number of powershell scripts that I also use to get things like the album/artist art from MusicBrainz (https://musicbrainz.org/) and TheAudioDB (https://www.theaudiodb.com/)
